As per DoT Directive, some Telecom Operators have started linking of SIM with Aadhaar via OTP based authentication. To know more about the process, please contact your respective Telecom Service Provider.
\n
->What is OTP?
 It is an one-time temporary password (OTP), that is generated by an algorithm and valid only for 30 seconds. Because of this time variable characteristic, it is called OTP.
OTP is 8 digit long numeric string.
OTP is personal to the resident and is uniquely generated every 30 seconds for each resident separately.
With time-based OTP, the TOTP validation server and token generation app(like mAadhaar) use their respective system times to generate OTPs. The TOTP algorithm assumes that the system times are synchronized.
\n
->Why to use OTP?
 OTPs avoid a number of shortcomings that are associated with traditional SMS based OTP. The most important shortcoming that is addressed by TOTPs is that resident will not be dependent on mobile network for SMS delivery. Generating and sending OTP requires users to go through a completely unrelated workflow.
\n
->How OTP is generated?
OTP is generated in mobile application like mAadhaar. However, the Client mobile deviceâ€™s time should be in sync with IST time-zone.
